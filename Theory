Pretrained model is a CNN/neural network architecture which anyone else has made and trained on different dataset but it is so good that it can be utilised in my problem.

Why use Pretrained model?
=>1)when we use CNN model then we work on some image based data.deep learnong is data hungry.For classification problem i need a lot of labeled data.labeling is a problem.
    manually labelling is tedious.
   2)Training process on big data takes time.
   
   so we can use a pretrained model.
   
ImageNET Dataset:-
Visual database of images.
